# Machine-Learning
A machine learning model is defined as a mathematical representation of the output of the training process. Machine learning is the study of different algorithms that can improve automatically through experience &amp; old data and build the model. A machine learning model is similar to computer software designed to recognize patterns or behaviors based on previous experience or data. The learning algorithm discovers patterns within the training data, and it outputs an ML model which captures these patterns and makes predictions on new data.
Machine Learning models can be understood as a program that has been trained to find patterns within new data and make predictions. These models are represented as a mathematical function that takes requests in the form of input data, makes predictions on input data, and then provides an output in response. First, these models are trained over a set of data, and then they are provided an algorithm to reason over data, extract the pattern from feed data and learn from those data. Once these models get trained, they can be used to predict the unseen dataset.

There are various types of machine learning models available based on different business goals and data sets.
