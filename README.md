# Machine-Learning
A machine learning model is defined as a mathematical representation of the output of the training process. Machine learning is the study of different algorithms that can improve automatically through experience &amp; old data and build the model. A machine learning model is similar to computer software designed to recognize patterns or behaviors based on previous experience or data. The learning algorithm discovers patterns within the training data, and it outputs an ML model which captures these patterns and makes predictions on new data.
